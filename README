IMPORTANT NOTES

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE.

Some testing has been done, and I'm sure there are bugs left.

As for additional features:  tell me what you want...

The GedNav pod section will be the main documentation, but it's not
really there yet...  :)

DESCRIPTION

This is the alpha release 0.02 of the GedNav module.

REQUIREMENTS

GedNav was developed using Perl 5.005_03.  Maybe it'll work with older
versions.  Maybe not.

It is written only in Perl, with standard distribution modules, so you
don't need any compiler nor special modules.  There are several modules
required that are not included with the standard Pel distribution:
Text::Soundex and GDBM_File, to name just a couple.  All required modules
should be noted by running Makefile.PL.

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

WARRANTY

This software comes with absolutly NO WARRANTY of any kind.
I just hope it can be useful.
